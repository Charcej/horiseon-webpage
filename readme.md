# Horiseon

## Purpose
A website for a company that aims to help strengthen the accessibility of websites.

## This Version
Per client request, I have done the following:
* Refactored existing webpage, making it accessible and improving SEO
* Making sure codebase follows accessibility standards

I did this by:
* Fixing a broken link
* Changing website title to 'Horiseon' to ensure a concise and descriptive title
* Changing HTML semantic elements and ensuring logical structure and sequential order for better clarity going forward
* Giving icon and image elements alt attributes where necessary, leaving them open for further tweaking at later date
* Cleaning up existing codebase to make it more efficient
* Leaving comments on both HTML and CSS files of all changes made, as well as identifying all sections for future tweaks

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
